### Transcript:

Hello. Today we will explore Material UI. 

It is a popular UI component library for React. It uses Google's Material Design principles: such as bold colors, material surfaces, intuitive interactions. Key features of MUI are: pre-designed components, responsive layout, theming capabilities. Pre-designed components help us to save our time and efforts during development of our application. Responsive layout helps us to be sure that our application looks great on every screensize and on every device. Theming capabilities help us to customize our application according to our needs and design preferencies.

The main benefit of using MUI is a Wide range of pre-built components. An we can look over some of them now.

First component is 'Button'. 'Button' has some variants and some colors. Color can be 'primary', 'secondary', 'error' and 'success'. And also we can use our own colors. 

Varians can be 'contained', 'outlined' and 'text'. In this slide we can see outlined buttons. 

If we don't choose any variant, by default we can see variant 'text'. In this slide we see a component 'Card'. And in the bottom of it there is a button variant 'text'. But as we can see it is just by default. 'Card' is very useful component and it consists of some small components like 'CardMedia', 'CardContent', 'Typography' and so on. Another great component is 'Grid'. It helps us to place our elements, such as 'Cards' or another components on the page.

Also we can use another interesting element 'IconButton'. We can customize it by choosing color. And inside it we can use components-icons. They are build-in components, so we don't need to search for them, download them. We can use ready-made icons.

Another great component is 'AppBar'. As we can see this is the simpliest implementation of it. But we can add some components into 'AppBar' to enhance its functionality.

Another great benefit of using MUI is Designing consistent user interfaces. MUI keeps things consistant. It uses easy-to-understand design rules. And it encourages us to use ready-made components. All of that points make our application looking cohesive, polished and professional. Our element in or application fit together.

There are alot of other benefits of using MUI. For example, Strong community an support. As we know many people use MUI. And we can find easily the information about components of MUI and some cases of using it. Also MUI has a great documentation and we can find all we need. Integration with other libraries. For example, we can use libraries such as React-redux or React-router to enhance functionality of our components. Constant updates and improvements. We can be sure that we use all of the latest features and bug fixes because MUI is up-to-date.

There are a lot of companies, more than 8000, that are using MUI. The most popular of them we can see on this slide. For instanse, Spotify, Amazon, Netflix and others. So MUI is a very popular library.

This is the end of my presentation. Today we explored MUI, its components, some of them, and some benefits of using this library. Thank you for your time and attention.

### Transcript:

Hi. My name is Irina. I am a beginning software developer. I live in Cedar Park, stateTexas. And this is the most difficult task of the course. Let’s begin.

I have a University degree in Accounting and made a good career in this field. But then I decided to change my life and learn something new. So I started my journey in learning JavaScript.

I studied for a year at Attractor School Bishkek on the course ‘Web-development JavaScript (React + Node.js)’. And during this course I made a lot of interesting and difficult projects not only on frontend, but also I created RESTful APIs. And since I finished this course I am constantly practicing learning JavaScript.  I solve problems on LeetCode and make mini projects for myself. For instance, I recently created an application for my daughter. This application shows mathematical tasks with fractions and the user has to answer and on submit the user gets a result if answers are correct or not. It was a very useful application for my daughter.

I hope that I continue learning JavaScript in RS School on stage 2, because this course is very useful for me. The main thing is it helps me to prepare for job interviews, because I am looking for a job now. It is a good program for learning, for filling some empty space in my brain. And I am very thankful for this course to RS School. I hope to see somebody from the creators of RS School as my mentor. So I am very hopeful. 

And I think that’s all. Thank you for your time, for watching me. 
And have a great day! 
Bye-bye!
